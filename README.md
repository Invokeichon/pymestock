# Pymestock

This is a project made for Software Engineering course at Universidad de Chile. The intent of it is to apply actual business practices with a "real" project.

## General Overview

Pymestock is a web app made with Django and Python (backend) and obviously HTML/CSS (frontend). The reason behind it is to have a platform where PYMEs could
register their companies and employees, where they could have inventory and stock handlers.
